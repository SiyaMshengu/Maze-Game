The Maze is a game that creates a 3D navigable world using ray casting to render a 2D map. It was developed in C using the SDL2 library/OpenGL and was built on Dev C++ using source files. The game is compatible with both Windows and Linux/Ubuntu operating systems. Ray casting was utilized in the game's development to create the illusion of a 3D environment.

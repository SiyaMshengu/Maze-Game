The Maze is a game that creates a 3D navigable world using ray casting to render a 2D map. It was developed in C using the SDL2 library and was built on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4. The game is compatible with both Windows and Linux/Ubuntu operating systems. Ray casting was utilized in the game's development to create the illusion of a 3D environment.
